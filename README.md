# IBRAP
 **I**ntegrated **B**enchmarking single-cell **R**NA-sequencing **A**utomated **P**ipeline endeavours to make optimal bioinformatic pipelines preconstructed into an ease-of-use tool, alongside providing gold-standard metrics to assess their effectiveness. 

Our current repertoire of tools are outlined in the following table:
