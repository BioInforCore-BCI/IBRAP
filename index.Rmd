#### Integrated Benchmarking scRNA-seq Analytical Pipeline

IBRAP is an interchangeable scRNA-seq tool that enables personalised pipeline production. We have integrated some of the majorly utilised components across R and Python. 

These tools are incorporated into the following pipeline: 

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics(path = 'man/figures/workflow.png')

```

Our currently integrated tools are the following:

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics(path = 'man/figures/new_tools_table.png')

```

Tutorials for how to IBRAP can be seen within the article section. They have been separated for easier understanding
